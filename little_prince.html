    <p1>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more</p1> <br/>
    <div id="line_1">
        <p2>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure</p2>  <br/>
    </div>
    
    <span id="line_2">
        <p3>It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</p3> <br/>
    </span>
    
    <p4>In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: </p4>  <br/>  

    <div id="line_3">
        <p5> "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</p5> <br/>
    </div>
    <p6>As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:</p6>
    <div id="line_4">
        <p7>"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a 
            flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even 
            whem he is asleep..."
        </p7>
    </div>
    <p8>And I felt him to be more fragile still.</p8>

    <div id="line_5">
        <p2>I felt the need of protecting him, as if himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</p2>  <br/>
    </div>
